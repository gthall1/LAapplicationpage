		<p style="font-size: 20px; PADDING-LEFT: 105px; PADDING-RIGHT: 105px">  Hi, my name is Griff Hall and I am applying to be in Launch Academy's summer cohort.  I am currently employed in the sales and marketing department for Vail Resorts, Inc.  I am passionate about technology and using it as a tool to make a difference in this world.  I have tried many different learning resources to try to learn on my own, but I am now ready to leave my current career and pursue programming full time.  I think that Launch Academy's reputation as a top development program speaks for itself, and I want to not only be a part of the program, but eventually a part of the Boston developer community as well.  I really want to attend Launch Academy to learn programming skills from the best, but I also want to learn other skills to help me become an all-around developer such as interview skills, paired-programming skills, and insights into the developer and start-up communities.  I know it will be a lot of hard work but I know it will be exciting and rewarding as well, and I am ready to be fully dedicated to becoming the best developer that I can be.
